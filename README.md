# Sudoku
A Sudoku game made in python 3

I used https://dlbeer.co.nz/articles/sudoku.html to help me work through the process of generating the board, but that turned out not to be in the scope of the project. I still included board generation anyway because I already had it written. The process for board generation was pretty much the same as the process for board solving anyway. 

to run: 
    cd to the folder containing "sudoku.py"
    run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    run "python3 sudoku.py"* in the consol
    Enter the name of a valid sudoku puzzle file to be solved.
        a valid sudoku file is a 9x9 grid consisting of numbers and 
          Xs representing blanks spaces
        The puzzle file must be in the same folder as sudoku.py

    *depending on what versions of python you have 
     installed, you may need to run "python sudoku.py" instead
